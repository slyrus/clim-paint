# clim-paint

clim-paint is a painting and drawing application written in Common
Lisp, using the [McCLIM](https://github.com/McCLIM/McCLIM) toolkit. It
is a very simple drawing program designed to show off some of the
features in CLIM, including presentations, commands, and various means
of program-user interactions.

Currently the program starts up with a single point displayed. One can
click and drag to move the point, or control-click and drag to add
another point and a line connecting the points. Subsequent clicks can
be used to move the points, control-clicks can be used to add
addtional points connected to an existing point, or lines, and the
points connecting them can be moved by dragging the line, or a line
can be split by control-clicking on the line.

In the future, I plan to add more types of drawn outputs (rectangles,
circles/ellipses, bezier curves, etc...) and to enable support for
editing shapes via the CLIM interactor.
